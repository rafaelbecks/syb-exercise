# Soundtrack Your Brand Exercise

This repository contains an example UI build for rendering a playlist history using the Soundtrack Your Brand API as part of a technical interview process.

The project is built using the lit.dev framework for standard web components.

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `nvm use` to match the `.nvmrc` node version.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run serve` for local development.
5. Run `npm run build` for building (not fully tested).

## Motivation

* Using lit.dev: Although I'm very comfortable with React, I recently started to prefer more minimal setupsâ€”not quite vanilla, but using just the bare minimum. Lit.dev looked interesting because it not only builds standard web components but also is very lightweight. It adds the reactivity I needed for this project, so I took the chance to try it out.

## Conclusions

It was easy to set up lit.dev to build something, but I think the build configuration with Rollup needs more work. From React, I missed using `styled-components`. Lit.dev has built-in CSS-in-JS, but what I like about styled-components is the ability to name my templates with specific, semantically meaningful names rather than just using tag names and classes.

Also, I would like to try composition with different components.

I missed trying out the testing setup with lit.dev using web-test-runner and Jest. There are many things I'd change and would like to try it out, but since this was supposed to be a 2-hour task, I didn't go that far.
